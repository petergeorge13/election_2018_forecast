# election_2018_forecast

Here is my forecast. Democrats win moderately big in the house and Republicans take the Senate by a small margin. I don't really know much about the political race and by not a lot I mean I know absolutely nothing about it. The problem of making specific predictions is that you first of all need to know who is running, which I do not. 

All I know for sure is that the polls will be off because polls are always bound to be off by a little bit, or a lot, one of the two. All of the statistics we have are based upon polls which could be accurate or severely not and I don't feel comfortable making any specific guesses (sorry, predictions) about who will win what. The key is that someone will win in each race, based upon certain factors that allow them to win. I believe a more in-depth analyses of how races turned out is more important towards races going forward than speculation on what will happen on the next race. If we really understand what factors effect who won each race, then those factors can be targeted in the next race.
